# Project notes

We are going to writting all relevant additional notes for the project.

# Getting Started

## Instalar bootstrap

1) npm install --save bootstrap@3 (With this we indicate the version one, even though we´re going to install the 4 version according to snippets plugin installed in VSC)
2) In angular.json file add the css style path 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
3) In sources in dev web tool we can see the style code loaded but sometimes it´s necessary to recompiling the project to apply the changes.

## Otras consideraciones

One important note: All the course code will only work if you are NOT using "strict mode" see the "First App" lecture in this module. Strict mode forces you to write more verbose code in some places (especially when it comes to class properties). If you enabled it by accident, you can also disable it by setting strict: false in your tsconfig.json file.
